# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
Breakout+ : A Modernized Breakout Game With Dynamic Power-Ups
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
Modified Python Breakout game that includes different power-ups, and unique gameplay elements will be my effort.  In order to make the game more. New aspects while building on the traditional Breakout concepts.
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
My project will be a Python-based arcade game inspired by the classic Breakout. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and uses it to bounce a ball to break bricks at the top. Beyond the original mechanics, my version will introduce new features such as power-ups or special bricks.
The game will track player score, remaining lives, and active power-ups. And it will run on Python using a graphics library such as Pygame.  
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable
I am not combining this project with another course
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable
Not applicable
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
A fully funtional Breakout game with a scoring sytem
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
A functional game with at least 2 working power-ups and improvements
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
A polished game with multiple power-ups, effects, special brick types, sound effects,  at least 3 levels, and a score tracker.
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
I will start by using the outline Python graphics Pygame and learning how to control movement and collisions in it with turtorials. Next, I will research how to make power-ups fall from bricks, how to make them change the paddle or ball for a short time. I also need to learn how to organize my code using classes for the ball, paddle, bricks, and power-ups. After that, I will slowly build each part of the game and test it to make sure it works. Since I am working alone, I will be responsible for every part of the project.
